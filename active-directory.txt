active directory: authentication and authorization

- enable self-service password reset

example of an AD action
- create dynamic group: create a security group / MS 365 group with dynamic group membership rules based on end user or device properties

***

when you transfer billing ownership of a subscription from an account in Azure AD tenant to an account in another Azure AD tenant, you're not required to associate the subscription with the new directory -- if you choose to:

- all users and groups with RBAC to manage the subscription lose access
- also applies to service principals
- RBAC assignments do not carry over when you associate the subscription with a new tenant
- class subscription admins like service admins and co-admins also lose access
- the only user initially able to manage resources in the subscription is the user account that accepts the transfer

could be useful if you want to reset existing management when transferring an AD tenant, but beware if you don't want to wipe out existing controls!

you would also end up losing an AKS cluster if AD tenant subscription is transferred, due to lost service principal rights and lost role assignments
