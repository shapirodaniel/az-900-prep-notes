azure cloud adoption framework

strategy: understand motivations, business outcomes/justification, prioritize project

plan: digital estate, initial org alignment, skills readiness plan, cloud adoption plan

ready: azure readiness guide, first landing zone, expand the blueprint, best practice validation

adopt: migrate, then innovate -- move the first workload, expand scenaria, validate best practices, improve processes, *then iterate and innovate

(govern and manage throughout -- methodologies and benchmarks should be iterated, and manage business commitments, ops baseline, and grow ops maturity over time)
