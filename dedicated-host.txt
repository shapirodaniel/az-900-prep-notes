azure dedicated host: a physical server dedicated to your org's workload only -- isolated physical servers, not shared with any other Azure customers, to meet corporate compliance guidelines and standards

- can't share provided physical servers across multiple Azure subscriptions
- since physical hosts are single-tenant, they are dedicated to one Azure subscription
- dedicated hosts are charged per dedicated host, no matter how many VMs you run on them
