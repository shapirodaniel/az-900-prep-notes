initiatives: a collection of Azure policies definitions, usually grouped with the aim of achieving a single goal

- used to simplify managing and assigning policies -- the same initiative can be assigned to multiple scopes to include resources, resource groups, subscriptions, or management groups

- when evaluated, all policies are evaluated -- move any policies you don't want to run with the others into a separate initiative

- initiatives can only contain policies located in the same subscription -- to assign the same initiative to scopes across multiple subscriptions, you must create policies and initiatives in each subscription
