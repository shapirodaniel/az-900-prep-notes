azure iot central: manage iot devices in a low-code environment

projects start with: generic or industry-focused templates -- create and connect devices, beginning from a device template

device templates define characteristics like:
- telemetry data types
- business properties that can be modified
- device properties that are read-only in-app
- properties that determine the behavior of the device, eg a target temperature for a temp sensor
- commands an operator can call that run on the device, eg remote reboot

***

iot central allows you to manage your devices through the app lifecycle

- dashboard: pre-built, or customized, shared with all users or none (private)

- rules/actions: build custom rules based on device state and telemetry to identify devices that need attention, and configure actions to notify the right people to undertake corrective measures

- jobs: apply single or bulk updates to devices
