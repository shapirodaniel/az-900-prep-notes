use SQL Server on Azure VMs for fast migration of SQL Server from on-prem to Azure with retention of operating system access: enables lift-and-shift from an on-prem datacenter to Azure with ease, while maintaining 100 percent compatibility with SQL Server and providing full access to the database engine and operating system on the VM level

use Azure SQL Database as a cost-effective serverless database with intermittent usage pattern and low compute utilization over time. serverless tier of Azure SQL Database is optimized for scenarios with intermittent or unpredictable usage patterns -- it automatically pauses the database during periods of inactivity and resumes when activity returns, enabling per second billing for compute consumed

use Azure SQL Managed Instance for lift-and-shift of on-prem SQL Server with minimal changes to an Azure PaaS solution -- Azure SQL Managed Instance has near 100 percent compatibility with the latest version of SQL Server Enterprise Edition, enabling frictionless migration to Azure with minimal application and database changes -- it's a PaaS offering, eliminating overhead for the management of underlying infrastructure

more generally: 

- SQL Server on VMs gives you a cloud migration platform that supports Windows Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and Ubuntu Linux and lets you BYO license images

- Azure SQL Database is a cloud implementation of MS SQL Server that lets you migrate on-prem SQL Server db without having to change your app
