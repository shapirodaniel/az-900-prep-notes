ex, company wants to host data disks on azure cloud
disks must be available to on-prem machines running win/lin/mac using network sharing via Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, and data must be secure at-rest/in-transit

choose file storage: supports SMB, allows multiple VMs to access the disks, more options for access including REST, client libraries

*don't use disk storage* -- stores data as a virtual hard disk (VHD) available *only to the VM it's attached to -- does **not provide outside access!

*don't use blob* -- very large quantities of unstructured data

*don't use archive* -- low-cost storage option for data that's rarely accessed
