workload: a collection of IT assets -- servers, VMs, apps, data, appliances -- that collectively support a defined process

- workloads can support more than one process
- workloads can depend on other shared assets or larger platforms
- a workload should have defined boundaries regarding the dependant assets and processes that depend on the workload

workloads can be visualized by monitoring network traffic among IT assets

***
